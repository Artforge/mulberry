1120 Bits of Advice I Learned Code Golfing with 140byt.es

140byt.es is a tweet-sized, fork-to-play, community-curated collection of
JavaScript, in which players collaborate to squeeze as much punch into 140
bytes as possible. It follows in the footsteps of popular JavaScript code-golf
championships 10K APART and JS1K, ratcheting down the size constraints another
order of magnitude to capture both the pith and the inanity of Twitter in
machine-readable form. In this talk, Jed will show how practicing the dying art
of hand-minification can help take your knowledge of JavaScript to the next
level.

Jed Schmidt is a Tokyo-based Japanese translator that enjoys abusing JavaScript
in his free time.
