## [Brendan Eich](http://brendaneich.com/)

Brendan Eich (/be) is the notorious inventor of JS and a drinker of all things
martini. If there ever was a 007 of JavaScript, it is this man. At a bar, you
will find him hidden in a dark corner illuminated by the gentle glow of a
laptop. Mystery is his middle name and often his topic for presentation.
Whatever Brendan steps up to speak about, be sure it will blow your mind.
Guaranteed.
