Back in the old days, the early web APIs were XML based and could only be
accessed from server-side scripting (like SOAP APIs - ick!). Nowadays, thanks
to modern web technologies and clever hacks, more and more APIs are
Javascript-friendly (look ma, no servers!). This talk will show you how we got
to where we are today, expose you to the wide number of APIs that you can use
from JS in your web apps, and equip you with tools & tips for using those APIs.
