As Etsy&#8217;s VP of engineering Marc Hedlund notes, the idea here is to ensure that about 50% of the next Hacker School class of about 40 participants will be female.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hackerschool.com/faq\">Hacker School</a> is one of the many recently launched programs that aim to teach budding programmers to become better hackers. It&#8217;s a three-month, full-time program based in New York. The application deadline for this year&#8217;s summer session is May 7 and the program will run from June 4 to August 25. Hacker School itself is a free program and those who get the Etsy grants &#8220;can spend the money on whatever expenses necessary to free you up for Hacker School, no questions asked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hacker School co-founder&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/1-summer-2012-applications-open\">Nick Bergson-Shilcoc</a> also notes that the female applicants will be judged on the same scale as men. &#8220;It frustrates us a little that we feel the need to say that,&#8221; writes Bergson-Shilcoc, &#8220;and we think it underlines the sexism (intentional and not) that so pervades the programming world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Etsy&#8217;s Marc Hedlund acknowledges that &#8220;20 is a small number,&#8221; but that he himself has only hired about 20 female engineers in the past 17 years. He also notes that he would be more than happy to hire any of the female engineers from this next batch of participants, &#8220;but more importantly, we just want to see these women go on to get fun, creative, lucrative jobs in technology \u2014 and hopefully tell other women about the great experiences they\u2019ve had.&#8221; At Etsy, a site that has given many female entrepreneurs a chance to start their own businesses, eleven women currently work in Engineering and Operations. That&#8217;s up from just three last September. Etsy has about 100 employees.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531716/\"></a> ",

AT&amp;T will also unlock your device if you&#8217;ve gotten sick of your contract and decided to shell out the early termination fee, or if you spent full price on it, rather than purchase it subsidized with a contract.

This makes social networking the top online activity in the U.S. today, with 15% of all U.S. Internet visits going to a social networking site. Experian&#8217;s report also found that Pinterest is now the third most popular social network in the U.S., right behind Facebook and Twitter. What&#8217;s more interesting than those rankings, though, is what the report tells us about social media&#8217;s most fervent users.</p>\n<p>Experian, for example, found that people who use social media regularly are significantly more likely to fly on Virgin Atlantic than the average online adult. These social media users are also more likely to drive a Saab, own an iPhone, eat at Au Bon Pain, Chevy&#8217;s and Chipotle, and shop at Payless Shoe Source and Victoria&#8217;s Secret.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, those adults who visit professional networking sites like LinkedIn more than the average Internet user actually prefer United Airlines (they are probably more interested in collecting frequent flyer miles and getting upgrades), Whole Foods and The Cheesecake Factory. Just like the average social media user, though, those who regularly frequent professional social networking sites are also more likely to own an iPhone than the average U.S. adult.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/experian_social_media_marketing_2012.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[531645]\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/expedian_social_media_marketing_2012_professional.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[531645]\"></a></p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531645/\"></a> ",

With Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Google, and a dozen other major companies established in the area, it&#8217;s never a surprise when you find out the guy next to you at the bar is working on Windows Phone 8 or Half-Life 3. This week, I was lucky enough to get a chance to see what Amazon has cooking for its next generation of e-readers. Their new offices and the mysterious Lab 126 are just down the street, after all, so I&#8217;m actually surprised it hasn&#8217;t happened before now.</p>\n<p>Back in November, I <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/will-the-next-wave-of-e-paper-devices-have-glowing-screens/\">speculated</a> that the new Kindles and Nooks and what have yous might have glowing screens, the likes of which we&#8217;ve seen occasionally but were never fully implemented. It turns out Amazon was thinking the same thing, and actually bought a company that was, I am told, the world leader in light-guide technology. They&#8217;ve finally gotten it to the point where it&#8217;s ready to be released, and a new generation of glowing Kindles will be coming our way sometime this year.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, that acquisition doesn&#8217;t appear to have ever been reported, so although it happened in late 2010, this is the first anyone has heard of it. The company, Oy Modilis, was founded in 1991 in Helsinki, and has a number of patents relating to this sort of thing. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents/US6773126\">This one</a>, for instance, seems to cover the type of lighting technology used in the new Kindle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The device I saw was crudely camouflaged in a sort of cardboard enclosure, but the screen was clearly visible. With a tap, a slider popped up on the screen, and as it was dragged to the right, the screen lit up evenly with a rather cool light. In the dark, it was plainly noticeable as a glow, and in uneven light &mdash; say, shade or a shuttered room &mdash; the slight illumination made the screen much more readable. At full blast it was definitely projecting some light (technically speaking it was <em>reflecting</em> it), but it was still a soft glow and not the harsh flashlight of a backlit LCD.</p>\n<p>I commented on the temperature of the light &mdash; it was that blue-white glow found in uncorrected white LEDs, not the warm light on off-white that most people associate with books by lamplight. But, of course, the e-ink screen is in fact grey and dark grey, not black on off-white, as paper is, so a cooler light may actually work better. At any rate, they are apparently sensitive to these issues and looking into it. I thought that the text looked better as well, but it&#8217;s possible that this was the result of improved font rendering and aliasing reduction, or perhaps something to do with the light. At any rate, it wasn&#8217;t any of the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/28/glareless-glass-flexible-solar-powered-e-paper-and-more-from-fpdi/\">crazy new bistable displays</a> we&#8217;ve been seeing at trade shows (alas).</p>\n<p>As for the shape of the device, it was impossible to tell, wrapped as it was in its little cardboard box. But the size appears the same, and the whole point of purchasing the light-guide company was to get the team and their patents, which essentially laminate the light diffusion layer right onto the screen without adding much in the way of depth or interfering with the touch system. I was told the industrial design isn&#8217;t finished yet, but I ruled out things like ruggedness, waterproofing, or a flush-front screen &mdash; all things, by the way, I suggested they look into. It shouldn&#8217;t be any thicker, though it will have to accommodate the LED circuitry and presumably a larger battery.</p>\n<p>The current crop of e-readers is, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/09/paper-or-plastic/\">as I recently lamented</a>, both troublingly homogenous and still not good enough for paper-lovers like myself. The new Kindle doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to address all of my issues with this kind of device, but the improved display will definitely set it apart from its rivals. We&#8217;ll know for sure when it comes out later this year.</p>\n<p>[note: the top image is a concept image from <a href=\"http://www.flexlighting.com/index.html\">Flex Lighting</a>, not a real device]</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531652/\"></a> ",

Pud, has been up to, wonder no longer: He&#8217;s working on a social network for musicians called <a href=\"http://www.fandalism.com\">Fandalism</a>. The site went live at the end of January, and without any publicity or advertising, it has grown to more than 350,000 registered users.</p>\n<p>You may remember Kaplan as the founder of the blog FuckedCompany and the ad network AdBrite. More recently, he co-founded social shopping startup Blippy, and when the product <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/19/the-end-of-blippy-as-we-know-it/\">failed to take off</a> (the other founders are working something new), he focused on smaller projects like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/12/pud-revisits-his-past-launches-an-email-newsletter-platform-with-tinyletter/\">newsletter-maker TinyLetter</a>, which was <a href=\"http://blog.mailchimp.com/mailchimp-acquires-tinyletter/\">acquired by MailChimp</a> in August.</p>\n<p>One thing you might notice: None of these projects seems particularly related to any others. And Fandalism continues that non-pattern. Kaplan says he has actually owned the URL for several years, at one point experimenting with using it as a &#8220;YouTube for songs.&#8221; He returned to the domain last year as a way to meet one of his own needs: He&#8217;s a musician (primarily a heavy metal drummer), and he wanted to connect with other musicians.</p>\n<p>Right now, Kaplan says the main way for musicians to find other musicians online is through Craigslist. There&#8217;s also <a href=\"http://www.indabamusic.com\">Indaba Music</a>, which similarly promises to help musicians find each other, but it&#8217;s more focused on collaborating on specific projects. (The site describes itself as a &#8220;the music creation marketplace.&#8221;) Kaplan wanted to make something that was more social, and also fairly straightforward and simple.</p>\n<p>When you create a profile on Fandalism, you enter basic information like where you&#8217;re located, the genres of music you play, and your influences. You can also answer questions about your musical history, such as &#8220;What was the first concert you went to?&#8221;, and share your work through photos, lyrics, and embedded YouTube videos and SoundCloud songs. Then, once your profile is set up, you can start following other members, posting comments on their profiles, giving &#8220;props&#8221; to their performances, and sending them private messages.</p>\n<p>As an example, you can <a href=\"http://fandalism.com/pud\">see Kaplan&#8217;s profile here</a>.</p>\n<p>Judging from the rapid, word-of-mouth user growth, it seems that other musicians also thought there was a need here. And it&#8217;s an international userbase \u2014 at one point during our demo, Kaplan started searching for musicians in random countries, and the only one that came up empty was Luxembourg. We even found <a href=\"http://fandalism.com/igornor\">someone in Kazakhstan</a>.</p>\n<p>The site was completely invite-only until earlier this week, when Kaplan opened it up a bit, allowing anyone to browse and search. However, you still need an invite from another member to create a profile and post \u2014 Kaplan says it&#8217;s a basic way to ensure that someone else is vouching for your talent as a musician, so he plans to keep membership invite-only for now. (You can also join as a non-musician, but you&#8217;ll need an invite for that, too.)</p>\n<p>As for making money, Kaplan says he has some ideas, such as allowing instrument manufacturers to advertise on the site. However, he doesn&#8217;t sound committed to any particular model right now. Nor does he seem particularly interested in raising funding, though he doesn&#8217;t reject the idea outright, or in hiring any employees. Yep, Kaplan has reached hundreds of thousands of members with a solo project, and while that isn&#8217;t quite <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2011/08/03/instagram-150-photos/\">an Instagram-level user-to-employee ratio</a>, he wouldn&#8217;t mind getting there someday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being able to be one guy and have a site with potentially millions of users \u2014 you can only do that now,&#8221; Kaplan says. &#8220;I would like to have 10 million users and still be one person.&#8221;</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531409/\"></a> ",

Back in July 2010, McClure filed for the accelerator&#8217;s first fund, raising $30 million  to begin officially investing in startups under the new venture capital fund. Today, we&#8217;ve learned <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1546669/000154666912000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\">via SEC regulatory filing</a> that round two is officially on the books, and 500 Startups is going bigger for its second round, raising $50 million. </p>\n<p>McClure and company are also today announcing an expansion of the team, as <a href=\"http://500.co/staff/paul-singh/\">Paul Singh</a> and <a href=\"http://500.co/staff/christen-obrien/\">Christen O&#8217;Brien</a> have been promoted to partners. Singh will continue to lead investments, running the accelerator program, and acting as head Data/Metrics guru, while O&#8217;Brien continues on her role as head of business development, leading events and conferences, like <a href=\"http://geeksonaplane.com/\">Geeks On A Plane</a>, <a href=\"http://warmgun.com/\">Warm Gun</a>, etc.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/bedy\">Bedy Yang</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/georgekellerman\">George Kellerman</a> have also joined as venture partners. </p>\n<p>Yang will be overseeing investments in Brazil and Latin America, while Kellerman will be scouting emerging talent in Japan. The group of four join existing partners Christine Tsai and McClure, and highlight not only the fact that 500 Startups is no longer a one-person show, but that the team has not only been diversifying, but increasing its focus on identifying and investing in international talent.</p>\n<p>In speaking with the Tsai and McClure, the founder was quick to point out that 500 Startups is no longer just an accelerator, but also a set of conferences, and a fund that invests not only in companies of its choosing but those of other accelerators as well. Of the some 257 investments 500 Startups has made to date, McClure says that more than 50 of those have been in other accelerators, including 25 from Y Combinator, 15 from TechStars, 5 from Seedcamp, 3 AngelPad companies, and 3 from Startmeet.</p>\n<p>While 10 to 15 percent of the fund&#8217;s current investments are in international startups, the partners said that, with the new $50 million fund, this will be increasing in the future, as it looks to build upon its investments in accelerators in Mexico City and Beijing, and beyond. For example, the team held a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePLjKTUg5Gw\">Geeks On A Plane trip to India</a> in December of last year, and intends to continue focusing on Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, both for Geeks On A Plane and in terms of investments, looking to build ties in those ecosystems.</p>\n<p>In October, the accelerator and fund peeled back the curtain on its third batch of startups, which included 34 companies, making it the largest roster to date (the initial batch consisted of 12 startups and the second came in at 21). Our coverage also touches on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/500-startups-peels-back-the-curtain-on-its-third-and-largest-batch-yet/\">500 Startups&#8217; growing domestic and international diversity</a>. You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yrNgq_ahsE\">500 Startups video here.</a> The accelerator&#8217;s fourth batch kicked off a few days ago, and we&#8217;ll have more on those companies soon.</p>\n<p>But another thing that&#8217;s interesting to note is that the accelerator is rolling out a new program that enables its mentors to co-invest in its accelerator companies &#8212; something that not many other accelerators or capital funds are doing at this point. Co-investing is not required for mentors, and all startups get the final say on which mentors can participate, but it&#8217;s a great opportunity for startups to get strategic angels on board, and conversely, an opportunity for mentors to invest in fast-growing stages early in their trajectory.</p>\n<p>500 Startups is also adding to its conference brigade, with a new event to be held on Friday April 20th, called <a href=\"http://mamabeartech.co/\">MamaBear</a>, which will be a one-day even focused on new technology for moms, kids, and families, with speakers representing companies like BabyCenter, Disney, Sesame Street, Plum District, MindSnacks and more.</p>\n<p>For more on 500 Startups current metrics, check out the infographic the team prepared with the help of the wizard designers over at <a href=\"http://visual.ly/\">Visual.ly</a>.

Among other things on their list of tactics, Microsoft has offered to fund process of bringing big-name apps to Windows Phone &#8220;where it makes sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Among the parties who have taken up Microsoft on their generous offer is Ben Huh of Cheezburger Network fame (not to mention soon-to-be <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/04/reality-tv-gets-startup-obsessed-with-bravos-silicon-valley-and-huh-working-titles/\">reality TV star</a>), who told the Times that Microsoft &#8220;took care of everything&#8221; when it came to developing a lolcat-touting Windows Phone app. Foursquare jumped on the wagon too, with bizdev head Holger Luedorf mentioning that a Windows Phone app was low on their list of priorities until Microsoft offered to underwrite its development.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is no stranger to this sort of thing &#8212; they&#8217;ve offered plenty of free Windows Phones to developers in the past in an effort to spark some interest in their still-growing platform.</p>\n<p>Despite Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/252959/windows_phone_market_share_is_so_small_nielsen_doesnt_even_list_it.html\">paradoxically small</a> presence in the mobile space they&#8217;ve got a decent-sized checkbook to play with. I can&#8217;t blame Microsoft for trying to buy love from developers &#8212; right now, they&#8217;re just fighting to keep up with major releases that have already found their way to other platforms. If they want to stand any chance at gaining traction in this market, they&#8217;ve got to give their customers the impression that they&#8217;re not missing out on anything by taking a chance on Windows Phone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/screen-shot-2012-03-22-at-08-27-041.png\" rel=\"lightbox[531595]\"></a>Take the Angry Birds kerfuffle for example &#8212; Rovio CMO/Mighty Eagle Peter Vesterbacka ruffled more than a few feathers when he remarked that Angry Birds Space wouldn&#8217;t find <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-22/-angry-birds-space-edition-skips-windows-phone-in-blow-to-nokia.html\">a home on Windows Phone</a>. Rovio followed up the next day with news that the franchise&#8217;s latest game would indeed make the WP transition, but writers and pundits had plenty of fun with the news while it lasted.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing Microsoft needs to avoid, and it seems as though they&#8217;ll grease the palms they need to to keep it from becoming an issue. While those highly popular, big-name apps may keep consumers from regretting their choice of smartphone, Microsoft still has another issue to contend with: many of the apps to be found are awful.</p>\n<p>You see, the news comes just a few days after the number of apps in the Windows Phone Marketplace tip-toed over <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/04/windows-phone-marketplace-growth-keeps-up-the-pace-tops-80000-apps/\">80,000</a> (that includes region-specific apps, your mileage may vary). It seems like it would be quite an achievement, and it gets them that much closer to the milestone, but sifting through the junk can be a hell of a thing. My former colleague (and my favorite Belgian) Robin Wauters has a great piece on <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/03/30/why-the-windows-phone-marketplace-is-looking-more-like-a-slimy-app-cesspool-every-day/\">The Next Web</a> about how the Windows Phone app store is populated by questionable, derivative crap.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, Microsoft knows about these cr-apps. Last year, they had to cut down on the number of apps a developer would be able to submit to the Marketplace in a<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/29/microsoft-cracks-down-on-spammy-windows-phone-app-submissions/\"> single day</a>, from 20 down to 10. It was all in an effort to stem the hordes of spammy app submissions that would flood the Marketplace&#8217;s New section, which meant that actual good apps from honest developers may not get the shot they deserved. It&#8217;s an environment that doesn&#8217;t always seem very conducive to developers on the up-and-up.</p>\n<p>And there will be plenty of those developers, if Microsoft has anything to say about it. The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304750404577321933818976966.html\">Wall Street Journal</a> notes that Microsoft has put plenty of time and money into sponsoring over 850 developer sessions across the globe in 2011, which the Journal says is triple the number they held the year before.</p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s awfully easy to rag on Microsoft and Windows Phone for its app troubles, but they&#8217;ve got a great opportunity here. The Windows Phone platform is the youngest of the major smartphone OS competitors, and while it isn&#8217;t as pervasive or as popular as iOS or Android, this sort of hands-on approach may end up paying off big time. It&#8217;s a fight that must be fought on multiple fronts &#8212; Microsoft should ideally be more stringent with submissions but keep the process smooth for well-reputed and promising developers, as well as making sure those big-name apps keep pouring in. Whether or not Microsoft&#8217;s machinations will make for a real three horse race remains to be seen, but you can bet that won&#8217;t keep the folks in Redmond from trying anyway.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531595/\"></a> ",

Apparently, developers are giving this one a shot&#8230;in droves. 5,500 developers have downloaded the mobile toolkit to date, with 562 apps in testing and 150 apps which have gone live with integrations. (<a href=\"http://blog.getsocialize.com/category/app-showcase\">Here</a> are a few).</p>\n<p>The startup is also now reaching over 10 million end users, up from 3.7 million in November. And its user base is doubling monthly, the company says.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sdk-apps.png\" rel=\"lightbox[531570]\"></a></p>\n<p>According to CEO Daniel Odio, via new downloads, the SDK now reaches 2 million end users (that is, users who download Socialize-infused apps). However, the majority of that 10 million figure comes via the company&#8217;s AppMakr channel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/socialize-end-users.png\" rel=\"lightbox[531570]\"></a></p>\n<p>For background, <a href=\"http://www.getsocialize.com/\">Socialize</a> actually grew out of the app-making service\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appmakr.com/\">AppMakr</a>, which had previously built apps for brands like Disney, The Washington Post, Newsweek and Politico. It later rebranded as Socialize with a focus on the social app SDK. Since then, AppMakr has served as sort of a testing ground for the new offerings, and was already reaching 3.7 million end users via the Socialize beta at the time of the Socialize Action Bar SDK public launch.</p>\n<p>Since then, the startup has been focused on boosting installs and impressions in apps running Socialize, and is helping developers bring in new users to their apps through the social actions of app users. As users comment, like, and share from within the app, they&#8217;re essentially serving as the app&#8217;s marketers.</p>\n<p>The company recently showcased a few success stories on its <a href=\"http://blog.getsocialize.com/2012/results-are-in-socialize-boosts-impressions-by-316\">blog</a>, where app makers were reporting increases in impressions and revenue. One, a finance app for the Spanish stock market, saw impressions go up 316%, and revenue up 257%. A couple of others, one a couponing app, another a fitness app, saw impressions increase by 120% and 103%, respectively.</p>\n<p>Socialize bootstrapped itself by selling a mobile consulting company called PointAbout to fund some of its growth, and currently has $1.5 million in angel funding to help it along.</p>\n<p>Now, with Apple&#8217;s phasing out of the UDID (the unique device identifier used for user tracking), the company hopes more developers will become interested in its service, which provides insight into user activity surrounding social actions &#8211; likes, comments, and shares.</p>\n<p>Developers can download the SDK for iOS or Android <a href=\"http://www.getsocialize.com/sdk/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/00070_wide_soc_entity1.png\" rel=\"lightbox[531570]\"></a></p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531570/\"></a> ",

In plain English, that makes it easier for companies to follow the metrics that matter most to them, whether that&#8217;s user retention after three or seven days or the number of users who complete a transaction. If you <a href=\"http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/Lexicon/CustomDashboards\">look at the example custom dashboard</a>, it shows &#8220;rolling retention&#8221; or how long an app keeps users after the day they download it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/Lexicon/FlurryAlerts\">Alerts can ping a mobile app maker if their usage spikes or suddenly declines, for example.</a>\u00a0Mobile app publishers can get these alerts by e-mail once a day. If they have several alerts set up, they&#8217;re all compiled into a single e-mail.<a href=\"http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/Lexicon/FlurryAlerts\"><br />\n</a><br />\n</p>\n<p>Then <a href=\"http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/Lexicon/FunnelAnalysis\">funnel analysis is super key for any sophisticated mobile app maker</a> that wants to understand if users are doing exactly what they want them to in the app. Are they buying virtual currency? Are they getting to Level 20 in a game? Flurry offers two types of funnels: one for tracking &#8220;in-app&#8221; events and one for tracking &#8220;cross-app&#8221; events. The latter is key because many developers with more than one app cross-promote users from one title into another. This is important in the gaming category as players sometimes get bored of one title, so developers need to coax them into playing other titles to keep them as a customer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Flurry competes with a host of other analytics providers like Apsalar, Localytics and Kontagent. But since Flurry was the earliest to market in 2008, it has the widest reach as it&#8217;s included in 170,000 apps. The company sees about 500 million unique smartphones or tablets per month, tracks 300 billion data transactions per month and sees 1.2 billion sessions per day. It&#8217;s in 18 of the 25 Top Grossing Apps in the iTunes store.</p>\n<p>And the growth is just continuing. Flurry has added about 35,000 apps from 10,000 companies since December. The number of sessions it tracks per day has jumped by 50 percent over the last three months. To be fair though, the other analytics providers have their own specialties. Kontagent, for example, has a long history in social gaming metrics that it brings over to mobile and Apsalar has a veteran team that&#8217;s done behavioral targeting and analytics in previous companies. But Flurry&#8217;s free analytics product has put some downward pricing pressure on the rest of the market.</p>\n<p>Even though analytics isn&#8217;t a core part of Flurry&#8217;s revenue stream, it has been a key part of the company&#8217;s business strategy. Analytics gives Flurry a relationship with thousands of developers that it can upsell to other advertising products like incentivized video clips, installs or targeted advertising.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get a lot of\u00a0goodwill from the developer community,&#8221; said Peter Farago, Flurry&#8217;s vice president of marketing. &#8220;And\u00a0the data set that we build up has other benefits in helping us create new products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flurry has raised more than $25 million to date in three venture rounds led by Menlo Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and InterWest Partners.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531573/\"></a> ",

With the added option, aspiring student developers can create Android apps right in the browser. When the project is complete the apps can be downloaded into APK format, then loaded up on your Android devices, shared with friends or sent off to the <del>Android Market</del>&#8230;Google Play store.</p>\n<p>And, says company co-founder Rajesh Moorjani, the startup is working on doing the same for iOS apps next.</p>\n<p>For a little background, <a href=\"http://www.programr.com/\">Programr</a> is a new entry in the &#8220;learn to code online&#8221; space, which has seen growing interest over the past several months, thanks in part, to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/codecademys-codeyear-attracts-100000-aspiring-programmers-in-48-hours/\">Codecademy&#8217;s &#8220;Code Year&#8221; initiative</a> which saw some 100,000 users sign up in just 48 hours of going live.</p>\n<p>This year, everyone wants to learn to code, it seems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.programr.com/\">Programr</a> isn&#8217;t as n00b-friendly as Codecademy, however &#8211; it&#8217;s more of a complement to that service. Where the latter is really about teaching you to code, Programr is like an online practice ground for creating projects, sharing them with friends, participating in contests, and taking online IT classes. Programmers can even earn points in the contests that allow them to gain free entry to the online classes (normally $30).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also more of a focus on higher-level languages at Programr. Over the past month, the company has added support for new languages including console (C++, C#, Java, Objective-C), web (PHP, Javascript, JQuery, Java Server Pages, AJAX), rich media (Flex, Processing), desktop (Java Swing), and database (SQL, SQLite). Others on the site include Ruby, Python, VB, AJAX, Flex, Flash, and more.</p>\n<p>The startup is also working with regional coding clubs to provide access to its online labs. For example, it recently teamed up with <a href=\"http://coderdojo.com/\">CoderDojo</a>, a club created by Xing co-founder Bill Liao and James Whelton to offer them a co-branded online lab. And Programr is making code widgets available to book publishers in order to make their code listings in their digital books interactive &#8211; these &#8220;live code listings&#8221; can then be run within the book with just a click.</p>\n<p>With the newly launched Android support, developers can create their mobile apps online and view in them in a web-based emulator. Besides games with a fast refresh rate, says Moorjani, there&#8217;s not a limit to the types of Android apps that run on the service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/touch-calculator-programr-103806.png\" rel=\"lightbox[531537]\"></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Students can learn Android coding by checking out the live code of the many Android apps created by other students at Programr. They can tinker with these existing live apps, enhance them by adding features, or then proceed to write their own apps from scratch,&#8221; Moorjani explains. &#8220;Once created, apps can be shared via a link, embedded in blogs, or then downloaded straight to Android devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To create an APK file, the code is compiled online and then a student clicks the &#8220;Download APK&#8221; button. You can see an example of the Android APK option\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.programr.com/Android/Touch_Calculator\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now the folks over at Programr are working on bringing iOS coding to the browser and adding sophisticated granular debugging support for all apps on its supported platforms.\u00a0They&#8217;re also working on\u00a0a Facebook app that would allow the site&#8217;s daily coding challenges to run right within Facebook itself, where the startup has some 33,000 fans (more than double Codecademy&#8217;s at last count, incidentally).</p>\n<p>Interested student programmers can sign up for Programr <a href=\"http://www.programr.com/user/login/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE: Looks like we accidentally crashed Programr.

As we <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/going-after-parents-pet-owners-foodies-more-fab-com-launches-weekly-shops/\">wrote earlier this year</a>, the fast growing site expanded their product offerings through the launch of the new Fab Shops, which incorporated verticals of Kids, Pets, Food, Fashion and Vintage.</p>\n<p>Fab co-founder, design guru and chief curator Bradford Shellhammer explains to us that Fab&#8217;s mantra is that design lives anywhere in the world at all price points, in all categories. While one wouldn&#8217;t necessarily associate beauty products with design, Shellhammer explains that when it comes to packaging and brands, design is a key component to the allure of certain beauty products.</p>\n<p>The new pop-up shop, which has been curated by Glamour and Fab editors, launches on Monday morning with high-quality make-up, luxurious skincare products, conditioning lip care, aromatic candles and more. Brands featured include Nest Fragrances, Philip B. Botanical Products, Oscar Blandi, Pangea, Demeter, josie maran, and malin + goetz.</p>\n<p>Fab is pretty stoked that an established media company like Conde Nast is willing to partner with the new guard for e-commerce and curation. Glamour Fashion Development Director Susan Cernek says of the new partnership, &#8220;The bulk of our 25,000 comments each month take place within our beauty vertical, so there\u2019s a strong community there. Partnering with Fab.com\u2014a site that has an equally robust and engaged community\u2014on a pop-up beauty shop is a natural fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shellhammer adds that beauty will become a more permanent vertical for the site and will be featuring more products soon. Clearly expanding to new verticals are only going to help Fab hit that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/01/one-year-post-pivot-fab-com-is-on-track-to-100m-in-revenue-in-2012/\">$100 million</a> in 2012 revenue. As Shellhammer says &#8220;there are only so many sofas you want to buy,&#8221; and beauty happens to be a vertical that has higher margins.</p>\n<p>Fab was <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/04/05/developer-spotlight--fab-com/\">also featured</a> yesterday in Facebook&#8217;s developer spotlight, revealing growth trends for the e-commerce site from Facebook&#8217;s social functionality. Fab says it has seen a 100% increase in the referral traffic from Facebook since launching its timeline app. And membership has grown from 1.8 million to more than 3.2 million users. While these stats are impressive, it&#8217;s important to note that referral traffic could also have been increasing pre-timeline because Fab has been exploding in growth over the past six months.</p>\n<p></p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531518/\"></a> ",

As we <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/going-after-parents-pet-owners-foodies-more-fab-com-launches-weekly-shops/\">wrote earlier this year</a>, the fast growing site expanded their product offerings through the launch of the new Fab Shops, which incorporated verticals of Kids, Pets, Food, Fashion and Vintage.\n\nFab co-founder, design guru and chief curator Bradford Shellhammer explains to us that Fab's mantra is that design lives anywhere in the world at all price points, in all categories. While one wouldn't necessarily associate beauty products with design, Shellhammer explains that when it comes to packaging and brands, design is a key component to the allure of certain beauty products.",

It packs all the standard BlackBerry apps and functions. Much as the iPad is a great iPhone companion, the PlayBook should be the BlackBerry user&#8217;s tablet of choice. The PlayBook is a fine tablet <em>now</em>. But it didn&#8217;t launch that way.</p>\n<p>The PlayBook launched last April to rough reviews. Common issues cited were the buggy OS, lack of 3rd party apps, and, strangely, RIM failed to include a calendar, email, and BBM functions. The tablet went nowhere and launched with a thud. It wasn&#8217;t until a drastic price cut and the addition of these missing features some seven months post launch that the PlayBook started moving. RIM saw a five fold increase in PlayBook sales <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/rim-falls-short-blackberry-shipments-down-21-from-q3-former-co-ceo-jim-balsillie-resigns-from-board/\">last quarter</a>.</p>\n<p>A 4G PlayBook makes sense in a strange way. RIM built the PlayBook to work tightly with its enterprise platform. In theory the PlayBook should work superior to the iPad in a corporate environment. Since RIM is actually now managing to sell PlayBooks, a 4G version should make traveling shower hook salesmen rather happy, since it can remotely dial the home intranet without relying on WiFi. Sure, these people might want an iPad, but IT departments can buy two PlayBooks for the price of one iPad and these tablets can be managed alongside the company&#8217;s existing BlackBerrys.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately a 4G PlayBook would flop in the consumer market like its WiFi brother. Even if it&#8217;s priced aggressively, the PlayBook lacks the sex appeal, and more importantly, the sheer amount of functions found on the iPad. Consumers looking for a cheap tablet will still look at the Kindle Fire or perhaps the rumored Google Nexus Tablet.</p>\n<p>RIM will likely launch the PlayBook the first week of May at its yearly BlackBerry World conference. The company needs to have a strong showing and a 4G PlayBook shows RIM is at least moving albeit rather slowly. If RIM is to recover, they need to get products on the market in a timely and complete fashion; that&#8217;s very clear. However, the company also needs to protect its revenue streams, and refreshing an old tablet with a relatively inexpensive addition like a 4G radio is a smart way to exploit the new demand and those still afflicted with the crackberry addiction.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531507/\"></a> ",

Just\u2026 ouch.</p>\n<p>HTC has tried to set the bar nice and low with their <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-06/htc-forecasts-first-quarter-sales-that-miss-analyst-estimates.html\">revenue and sales guidance</a> for the quarter, but now we\u2019re getting a look at how rough this past quarter has really been. Back in February, HTC Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung pegged the company\u2019s sluggish quarter on increased competition from rivals like Samsung and Apple (a reason they seem to like trotting out often), but he was quick to note that HTC was just as much at fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe simply dropped the ball on products in the fourth quarter,\u201d Yung said in a February conference call. He also noted that the company&#8217;s LTE devices in particular &#8212; think the Rezound and the Vivid &#8212; didn&#8217;t live up to company expectations.</p>\n<p>The numbers don\u2019t look very promising, but the company hasn\u2019t exactly been sitting on their laurels this whole time. Not long after the company revealed that they would be refocusing their efforts around a smaller number of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/26/htc-wants-hero-smartphones/\">\u201chero\u201d devices</a> in 2012, they officially pulled back the curtains on their impressive new One series devices.</p>\n<p>After having <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/26/tcmwc-hands-on-with-the-htc-one-x/\">played</a> with the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/26/tcmwc-hands-on-with-the-htc-one-s/\">devices</a> (along with their new <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/04/hands-on-with-the-htc-evo-4g-lte/\">American cousin</a>), I get the impression that HTC may not be stuck in this current hole for too much longer. There\u2019s no question that HTC has spent a good chunk of 2011 spinning their wheels when it came to innovative design and functionality (did they really need to make 4 variants of the Sensation?), but the One series seems like a breath of fresh air in comparison to the reiterative devices they churned out for a while.</p>\n<p>Still, while HTC is getting their hardware affairs in order, that competition from Apple and Samsung isn&#8217;t going anywhere. With a new iPhone and the Galaxy S III waiting in the wings for their respective debuts later this year, HTC may still have some rough seas ahead of them. At least this time though, they&#8217;ll have some hardware that could actually put up a fight.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/531512/\"></a> ",
