The following are required for installation:

1. XCode (for gcc and other unix tools)
2. Ruby 1.9.3 (although other rubies ought to work)
3. Rubygems / Bundler
4. Android SDK
5. PhoneGap/Cordova
6. Placement of the Mulberry executable in your $PATH

The installation script will attempt to install Ruby via rvm and the Android
SDK via Homebrew. It will also add the Mulberry executable to your
.bash_profile.

Do you wish to proceed with the installation of rvm, ruby, and homebrew/packages (Y/n)?
