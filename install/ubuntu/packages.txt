The following are required for installation:

1. gcc
2. Ruby 1.9.3 (although other rubies ought to work)
3. Rubygems / Bundler
4. PhoneGap/Cordova
5. Placement of the Mulberry executable in your $PATH

The installation script will attempt to install Ruby via rvm. It will
also add the Mulberry executable to your .bash_profile.

Do you wish to proceed with the installation of rvm, ruby, and other packages (Y/n)?
